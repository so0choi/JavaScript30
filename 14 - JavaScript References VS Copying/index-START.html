      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      console.log(players, team)
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = 'Lux';

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      console.log(players)
      console.log(team)
      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[0] = 'Soyeong'
      console.log(players, team2)
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team3 = [].concat(players)
      team3[0] = 'HI'
      console.log(players, team3)
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]
      team4[0] = 'ES6'
      console.log(players, team4)

      const team5 = Array.from(players)
      team5[0] = 'from'
      console.log(players, team5)
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 99;
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 1 })
      console.log(cap2)

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const cap3 = {...person}

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
